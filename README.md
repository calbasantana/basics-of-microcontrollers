# Introduction
This repository is dedicated to teaching the basics of microcontrollers to someone who is unfamiliar with the devices. We will be using an ESP32 as the microcontroller basis for this repository (see image above), but do know that there are many different microcontrollers out there, such as:

Raspberry Pi Pico
Arduino Uno
Arduino Nano
Seeed Studio XIAO


And those are just a few of many ...

We will be using Thonny as the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of choice for us and MicroPython as the language of choice for communicating with the ESP32. To download Thonny, please go to: 

One of the first things you need to do with Thonny is to configure it. On the bottom right corner of it, you will find the Interpreter have it set for MicroPython (ESP32). You may need to install this on the ESP32 if it doesn't come with it so make sure to follow directions on flashing MicroPython to it (usually it's just holding down the button). Once it's configured, this is what you'll see:
